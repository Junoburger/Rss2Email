# Rss2Email

This project collects blog posts made over the last `n` days from RSS feeds and emails them to you!

## Why?

I have a few blogs in mind that I do find interesting but they do not provide a newsletter.

There are some RSS readers but I am too lazy to download and use other software exclusively for this,
I would much rather see a summary of these posts in my mailbox.

## Getting Started

This section was getting rather lengthy so I moved it to [the Wiki](https://github.com/AntoniosBarotsis/Rss2Email/wiki#getting-started)!

## Why is this so Slow?

Currently, the RSS feeds are downloaded in a sequential, blocking manner as they are only small text files
and should thus not take too long (plus this is not supposed to run that often but rather something
like once a week or so). 

If you find yourself either using a *lot* of RSS feeds or really big ones somehow, do give me a heads up
by submitting an issue and I'll do what I can to make this faster. As of now, there is no reason to do that. That said, I might randomly
decide to do this regardless.
